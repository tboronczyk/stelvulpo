DEV NOTES

CCR and PCR files in SG/DATA are compressed. Use sf_decrunch
to decompress and sf_crunch to recompress.

Files in SG/MSPRITES are interleaved. use fx2cgx to separate
images and cgx2fx to recombine.

If working in Cygwin and want to compile tools for use on
Windows without Cygwin, can cross compile with mingw.

x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++ filename.cpp -o cmdname

MOJI_O.FON used for in-game text
MOJI_2.FON used for end credits

eo_comms is slop utility to preview comm messages (check for
spacing and number of lines used)

starfox_spc_driver - compile and copy SGSOUND0.BIN to SG/SND

star-fox-sound-bins - compile and copy to SG/SND

Translatable text is in:

 ENDSEQ.ASM - parade of enemies
 GAMEMSGS.INC - comm and briefing messages
 GAMETEXT.ASM - end of level text
 MDATA.MC - end credits 

THE END at end credits is 3D modeled letters. See 
github.com/Sunlitspace542/FastFX (letter forms are in
KSHAPES.ASM and SHAPES2.ASM)

AND.PCR - Andross PCR restored
CONT-2.CCR - Settings Controller
FOX.CCR - Continue
MAP.CCR - Level Map
OBJ-1.CCR - HUD (ENEMY, SHILEDS), STAGE/TRAINING/SCRAMBLE
CP.CCR - Start Screen (PRESS START)
TI-3-US.CCR - logo

re-arranged sounds (wing blaster) or playing/duration details
in starfox_spc_driver/SGSOUND0.ASM

replace sounds in star-fox-sound-bins

Audio samples are in brr

Record originals as mono 32000 Hz 16-bit signed WAV
use Audacity Effect > Pitch and Tempo > Change speed and Pitch to shrink
Then encode with snessr:

tools/snessr.exe -e input.wav output.brr

Full compile (from Cygwin):

cd starfox_spc_driver
cmd /c make.bat
cp SGSOUND0.bin ../SG/SND/SGSOUND0.BIN
cd ../star-fox-sound-bins
cmd /c make.exe SHELL=cmd.exe
cp build/*BIN ../SG/SND/
cd ..
./build.cmd


Edit RAM to cheat during testing:
Enable dual blasters: Set bit 0 of PSHIPFLAGS2 (RAM $000014D9) to $01
Enable plasma blasters: Set bit 4 of PSHIPFLAGS3 (RAM $000014DA) to $10
Number of smart bombs: Set SPECWEPCNT (RAM $000015AF)
